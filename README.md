The purpose of this repository is to store and manage SVG files used across multiple projects. By centralizing these assets, I aim to achieve the following:

- <b>Centralized storage:</b> Keep all SVG files in one place for easy access and management.
- <b>Reusability:</b> Enable reuse of SVG assets across multiple repositories without duplicating files.
- <b>Consistency:</b> Ensure a consistent look by using the same assets in different projects.
- <b>Ease of updates:</b> Simplify the process of updating SVG files by making changes in one location.
